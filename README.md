# Maze Game

Hello,  welcome to the Maze Game.

This project implements a complete maze game from scratch.\
The project consists of three parts: A,B,C.

### Part A
- Implements Kruskal and Prim maze generation algorithms.
- Implements BFS, DFS, Best first search algorithms to solve the maze.

### Part B
- Maze compression using serialization.
- Decorator design pattern.
- Client-Server model using thread pool (generating and solving mazes).
- Strategy design pattern.

### Part C
- GUI implementation.
- MVVM architecture (Model-View-Viewmodel).
